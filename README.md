Blazor CRUD with State Machine
This repository contains a sample application built with Blazor, showcasing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MudBlazor Grid and Fluxor state management.

Overview
This application demonstrates how to implement a CRUD interface using Blazor, a framework for building interactive web UIs with C# instead of JavaScript. The core features of this project include:

MudBlazor Grid: Utilizes the MudBlazor library for a Material Design-inspired data grid component, enabling efficient data display and interaction.
Fluxor State Machine: Implements state management with Fluxor, a library inspired by the Flux pattern and Redux, to manage application state in a predictable and centralized manner.
